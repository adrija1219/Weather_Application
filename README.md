# Weather Application
A simple and responsive weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it with a clean, color-themed UI that changes based on the weather conditions.

Features:

Real-time Weather Data: Get current weather for any location you search for.

Dynamic UI: The background and color scheme adapt to reflect the weather (e.g., a sunny theme for clear skies, a gray theme for clouds).

Intuitive Design: A clean, minimal interface that's easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
